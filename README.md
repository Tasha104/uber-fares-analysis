 Methodology

1. Data Download:
   - Downloaded from [Kaggle Uber Fares Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset).

2. Data Cleaning & EDA:
   - Loaded data with Pandas.
   - Checked data structure & missing values.
   - Dropped rows with missing coordinates.
   - Performed basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std dev).
   - Detected outliers using IQR.
   - Engineered new features: hour, day, month, day_of_week, peak/off-peak.

3. Data Export:
   - Saved the cleaned dataset as uber_clean.csv.

4. Dashboard Design in Power BI:
   - Imported 'uber_clean.csv'.
   - Created visualizations:
     - Fare amount distribution (histogram)
     - Rides by hour, day, and month (time series)
     - Pickup locations (map)
     - Filters for day of week and peak/off-peak times.
   - Added slicers for interactivity.
   - Designed layout with clear titles and formatting.
